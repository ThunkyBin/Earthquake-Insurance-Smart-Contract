The owner and premium variables are made public for visibility. The payoutAmount is kept private.

The Insurance struct stores information about each insured user - their address, amount insured for, and an active flag.

The insurances mapping associates each insured address with their Insurance struct. This allows us to store and retrieve information about each insured user.

The InsurancePurchased and PayoutProcessed events are emitted when relevant actions are taken.

The buyInsurance() function allows users to purchase insurance by paying the premium amount. It updates the insurances mapping to mark that user as insured.

The processPayout() function allows the contract owner to payout funds to an insured user. 
It requires the insured user to still be active, then sends the payoutAmount to the insured user's payable address. It then marks that user as inactive.

The withdraw() function allows the contract owner to withdraw any excess funds from the contract's balance.

Ownable.sol:

This basic Ownable contract defines an owner address. It is inherited by the EarthquakeInsurance contract, which then gains an owner.

The Ownable contract provides _owner() and onlyOwner modifier functions. These restrict certain actions to only the contract owner.
